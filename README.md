## Overview

The objective of this project is to use a pretrained nueral network and modify it to change the prediction targets.

## How to install dependencies

The declared dependencies are in `src/requirements.txt`.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## How to hydrate Jupyter Notebooks

For the ease of sharing the notebooks Jupytext  was used to save them in plain text, and avoid the hassle of the notebooks metadata.

To open them, run:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then open them as it they were notebooks to generate the .ipynb files.
